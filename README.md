# EDA_Coffee_Data_project

CQI maintains a web database that serves as a resource for coffee professionals and enthusiasts who are interested in learning about coffee quality and sustainability. The database includes a range of information on coffee production, processing, and sensory evaluation. It also contains data on coffee genetics, soil types, and other factors that can affect coffee quality.


 Analysis Method: 
Our analysis plan will be undergoing following steps :
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights about the raw data, identify potential data problems, features and target variables, as well as metrics.
Preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning. This will be done in two steps :
Cleaning the data to remove the identified issues
The code in this project will be written in Python and we will be mostly using Seaborn for data visualization.
